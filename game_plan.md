# Platform Game Development Plan

## Project Overview
A 2D platform game inspired by Super Mario Bros, built with Rust and macroquad. This will be an iterative learning project focusing on game development fundamentals.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Rust
- **Graphics Library**: macroquad
- **Game Type**: 2D Side-scrolling Platformer

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-3)
**Goal**: Basic game window and core loop

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Rust project with Cargo
   - Add macroquad dependency
   - Create basic main.rs structure

2. **Game Window & Loop**
   - Create game window (800x600)
   - Implement basic game loop
   - Add background color
   - Test window creation and FPS

3. **Basic Input System**
   - Capture keyboard input
   - Implement basic movement controls (WASD/Arrow keys)
   - Test input responsiveness

### Phase 2: Player Character (Steps 4-6)

4. **Player Entity**
   - Create player struct
   - Add position and size properties
   - Render player as colored rectangle
   - Test player rendering

5. **Player Movement**
   - Implement horizontal movement
   - Add basic physics (velocity, acceleration)
   - Smooth movement with delta time
   - Test movement mechanics

6. **Gravity & Jumping**
   - Add gravity system
   - Implement jumping mechanics
   - Ground collision detection
   - Test jumping and falling

### Phase 3: World Building (Steps 7-9)

7. **Simple Level Design**
   - Create platform/ground tiles
   - Static level layout
   - Basic collision detection
   - Test player-platform interaction

8. **Improved Collision System**
   - Rectangle-based collision detection
   - Separate X and Y axis collision handling
   - Prevent player from falling through platforms
   - Test collision accuracy

9. **Camera System**
   - Follow player with camera
   - Smooth camera movement
   - Keep player centered
   - Test camera behavior

### Phase 4: Game Mechanics (Steps 10-12)

10. **Enemies**
    - Simple enemy entity (Goomba-like)
    - Basic AI (left-right movement)
    - Enemy-player collision
    - Test enemy behavior

11. **Power-ups & Items**
    - Collectible items (coins)
    - Simple power-up system
    - Score tracking
    - Test item collection

12. **Game States**
    - Start screen
    - Game over screen
    - Pause functionality
    - Test state transitions

### Phase 5: Polish & Enhancement (Steps 13-15)

13. **Sound Effects**
    - Jump sounds
    - Collision sounds
    - Background music
    - Test audio integration

14. **Visual Improvements**
    - Sprite rendering (replace rectangles)
    - Animation system
    - Background graphics
    - Test visual enhancements

15. **Level Progression**
    - Multiple levels
    - Level completion detection
    - Progressive difficulty
    - Test level system

## Key Learning Objectives
- Game loop architecture
- 2D physics simulation
- Collision detection algorithms
- Game state management
- Input handling
- Camera systems
- Entity-component patterns

## Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Player can move and jump (Phase 2 complete)
- **Milestone 2**: Basic platforming works (Phase 3 complete)
- **Milestone 3**: Core gameplay loop (Phase 4 complete)
- **Milestone 4**: Polished game experience (Phase 5 complete)

## Next Steps
We'll start with Phase 1, Step 1: Project Setup. Each step will be implemented incrementally with testing and validation before moving to the next step.
